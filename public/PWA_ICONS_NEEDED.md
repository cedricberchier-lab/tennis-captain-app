# PWA Icons Needed

For iOS Safari notification support, you need to add these icon files:

1. `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
2. `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

## How to create icons:
1. Design a simple tennis/app icon (can use tools like Canva, Figma, etc.)
2. Export as PNG files with the exact sizes above
3. Place them in the `/public` folder
4. Icons should have your app branding (e.g., tennis racket, "TC" text, etc.)

## Colors to use:
- Primary: #9333ea (purple)
- Background: #ffffff (white)
- Text/Logo: High contrast

Once you add these icons, the PWA will work properly on iOS Safari for notifications.
